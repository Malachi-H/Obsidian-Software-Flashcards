How many columns should a desk check have?
?
1 for each variable + 1 for an output column


How do you perform a desk check?
?
- Move left to right, top to bottom. 
- Never backtrack, if you need to change a variable that's to the left of the one you just changed, move down a line first. 
- If anything is printed or returned, write it in the output column
- At any point, you should be able to read the current contents of each variable by reading the bottom most value in each column.
