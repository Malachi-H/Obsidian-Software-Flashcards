### Sorting Algorithms

List the 3 relevant sorting algorithms:
?
- Bubble Sort
- Insertion Sort
- Selection Sort


What is does bubble sort do?
?
Swaps adjacent values to "bubble" the larger/smaller values to the end/begging of the list


What does insertion sort do?
?
Moves the values one by one into a sorted array (either new or a part of the original). When the next value is added the the sorted array, it is placed in the correct location to keep the array sorted.


What does selection sort do?
?
Selection sort finds the smallest or largest value in an unsorted array and moves it to the beginning or end of a new sorted array (either new or part of the original array)
