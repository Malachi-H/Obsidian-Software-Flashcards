___
What are the installation methods?
?
- Direct Cut-Over
- Parallel
- Phased
- Pilot 

___
What is the Direct Cut-Over Installation method?
?
- Old system is dropped and new system installed at the same time.
- Used when not feasible to run both systems at the same time
- Data must be converted and imported from old system.
- Users must be trained on new system prior to installation

___
What is the Parallel Installation method?
?
- Both systems operate together for a period of time.
- Allows major problems with new system to be sorted without loss of data
- Users have time to familiarise themselves with new system.
- Used when system is crucial

___
What is the Phased Installation method?
?

___
What is the Pilot Installation method?
?
- New system is initially installed for a small number of users.
- Users can test system - often considered final test
- Users can learn system so they can teach others
