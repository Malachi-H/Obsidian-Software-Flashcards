- [ ] Flow Chart
- [ ] Sorting Algorithms 
	- [ ] Quick Sort
	- [ ] Recognising from Consecutive Sort Steps
- [ ] Searching Algorithms 
	- [ ] Searching Algorithm 1;; Sequential 
	- [ ] Searching Algorithm 2;; Binary 
- [ ] Streams (start and end)(parity)
	- The Data Stream sections are;; The Header, the Data Block, and the Trailer Information 
	- Trailer Information
		- [Parity Bit Infomation](https://www.tutorialspoint.com/what-is-a-parity-bit)
		- The Trailer Information Contains;; Error checking bits and a stop bit
		- What are the differences between odd and even parity bits?;; <br>Even Parity − Here the total number of 1 bits in the message is made even. <br>Odd Parity − Here the total number of 1 bits in the message is made odd. 
		- What is the value of an even parity bit in a data stream if the number of 1's is even;; 0   
		- What is the value of an even parity bit in a data stream if the number of 1's is odd;; 1 
		- What is the value of an odd parity bit in a data stream if the number of 1's is even;; 1   
		- What is the value of an odd parity bit in a data stream if the number of 1's is odd;; 0  
		- 
		- What is the value of an even parity bit in a data stream if the number of 0's is even;; 1   
		- What is the value of an even parity bit in a data stream if the number of 0's is odd;; 0 
		- What is the value of an odd parity bit in a data stream if the number of 0's is even;; 0

- [ ] Software Development Cycle
	- [[#^7f1dfa|Flashcards]]
	- Software Development Cycle Stage 1;; Defining and Understanding the Problem 
		- Determine the requirements of the system and needs of client
		- Study existing systems and consult with users
		- Feasibility study undertaken
		- Design specifications are made
		- Development plan is constructed
	- Software Development Cycle Stage 2;; Planning and Designing the Solution 
		- Design of data structures
		- Algorithms are created
		- Interface design in consultation with client
		- Project is broken down into modules
	- Software Development Cycle Stage 3;; Implementing the Solution

		- Solution is coded in a programming language
		- Each module is tested as it is coded and then tested in combination with others
		- Documentation is made
	- Software Development Cycle Stage 4;; Testing and Evaluating the Solution 
		- Testing for errors as well as performance under live conditions
		- Evaluate the system to ensure that all requirements have been met
	- Software Development Cycle Stage 5;; Modifying/Maintaining the Solution 
		- Upgrading to correct errors, add new functionality, improve current functionality
		- Each modification uses the steps of the software development cycle
- [ ]  Installation Methods 
	- [[#Methods of Installation|Flashcards]]
	- Direct cut-over
		- Old system is dropped and new system installed at the same time.
		- Used when not feasible to run both systems at the same time
		- Data must be converted and imported from old system.
		- Users must be trained on new system prior to installation
	- Parallel
		- Both systems operate together for a period of time.
		- Allows major problems with new system to be sorted without loss of data
		- Users have time to familiarise themselves with new system.
		- Used when system is crucial
	- Phased
		- Gradual change from old system to new.
		- New product introduced one part at a time
		- Often used when product is still under development.
	- Pilot
		- New system is initially installed for a small number of users.
		- Users can test system - often considered final test
		- Users can learn system so they can teach others

- [ ] Rights of software developers 
	- Categories of the Rights of software developers;; Intellectual Property, and Quality
	- 
	- What is Intellectual Property?;; Property resulting from mental labour
	- Intellectual Property Rights of Developers;; work must be acknowledged and fairly compensated by publishers
	- 
	- Developer Rights Regarding Quality;; Developer has the right to expect that the hardware and operating systems both operates reliably. 
- [ ] Responsibilities of software developers 
	- Categories of the responsibilities of software developers;; Intellectual Property, Quality, Response to Problems, Malware  
	- 
	- Intellectual Responsibilities of developers;; Developers have the responsibility to acknowledge the work of others. 
	- 
	- What are the factors which determine a software's quality?;; correctness, reliability, efficiency, integrity of data, usability, stability, portability, 
	- Responsibilities of the Developer Related to Quality;; Solutions should be high quality (especially when involving important data) to reduced the inconvenience of errors 
	- How is the quality of software ensured?;; Through planning, testing, and QA (eg. Discussion with client to ensure software is satisfactory)
	- 
	- Responsibilities of the Developer Related the Response to Problems;; timely, accurate, and efficient response to problems
	- How can a Software Developer Ensure a timely, accurate, and efficient response to problems?;; Have a method to assist identification and resolution of errors. Have unambiguous error messages. Have a way to respond to user problems such as a support department
	- 
	- Responsibilities of the Developer Related Malware;; Ensure their products do not generate, feature, or transmit malware.
	- How can a Software Developer ensure that their products do not generate, feature, or transmit malware?;; Check new data and software added for viruses. Scan all emails and attachments received by employees. Update antivirus software regularly. Scan all software before distribution. Use firewalls and other security mechanisms.
